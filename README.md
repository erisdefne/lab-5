**Description:**

The program will analyze a user's Spotify and provide a breakdown of their music taste based on their listening history or playlists according to the genre criteria that we’ve created depending on song genre, artist, mood, or other extracted key characteristics. The program will be able to:

-Help users to connect their Spotify account and select playlists for analysis. <br/>
-Determine new genre specifications based on certain criteria. <br/>
-Give insights and suggestions for new music based on the user’s listening habits. <br/>
-Export a summary report of the user’s musical taste breakdown based on their playlist. <br/>
-Compare the playlists of two users logged at the same time to determine how much they are alike.
